# Predicting-lung-cancer-using-ML-and-DL
Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting lung cancer outcomes using both machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques. The dataset contains patient information, diagnosis details, and treatment timelines, which are processed and analyzed to build predictive models.

Key Steps

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and duplicate records.

Converted date features into numerical representations (e.g., months, treatment duration).

Encoded categorical variables using Label Encoding.

Balanced the dataset using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualized numerical and categorical distributions.

Used histograms, boxplots, and countplots to analyze survival patterns.

Modeling

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Applied various Machine Learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM).

Implemented a Deep Learning Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras.

Model Evaluation

Compared performance across models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices.

Evaluated deep learning performance alongside traditional ML models.

Results

The study highlights which algorithms perform best for predicting survival outcomes in lung cancer patients.

Deep learning showed competitive performance when compared to traditional ML models.
